            <p>On November 30th, Sorry Inc. Arts welcomed with open Arms the <br />
                grosomely ironic Artist Joan Cornella. It was a wonderful event <br />
                because Joan was promoting his new book “Everyone Dies Alone” <br />
                with a signing at our Chicago location from 3PM-7PM. Joan is very <br />
                successful on social media particularly on Instagram with a huge<br />
                audience of 2.5 million. We are thankful for Joan choosing one of <br />
                our controversial galleries to hold this awesome event.

        <div id="bio-text">
            <p>Joan Cornellà Vázquez (born 11 January 1981, Barcelona) is a cartoonist <br />
                and illustrator famous for his unsettling, surrea l humor and black humorous <br />
                comic strips as well as artwork.Cornellà’s work has often been described as <br />
                disturbing or flat-out offensive. Through simplistic visual language, he is able <br />
                to use satire to comment on the sinister and often bleak side of human nature <br />
                through a myriad of unconventional scenarios. Everything from our unnatural <br />
                connection to social media and masturbatory selfie culture to political topics <br />
                such as abortion, addiction and gender issues - no subject is off limits. <br />
                Cornellà’s work revels in its absurdity and impropriety.</p>
