            Artist Quote
        </div>

        <div id="bio-text">
            <p>“People have told me that these characters are intensely threatening <br />
                or aggressively sexual,” Neri explained. “I don’t see them as hypersexual,<br />
                 though. They’re a fractured character dealing with hierarchies, power struggles.” <br />
                 The artist views each yellow-haired, pink-skinned figure — inspired both by<br />
                  women in her family and the blond bombshells depicted in Pop Art — as a facet<br />
                   of the same imagined character, which is in part informed by Neri’s own various <br />
                   identities as a mother, lover, daughter and maker. Barefoot and seated on one <br />
                   of her father’s solid timeworn chairs, Neri answered T’s Artist’s Questionnaire.</p>
